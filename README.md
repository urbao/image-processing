# 2023 NCKU Image Processing Project Code

### Including several common image-processsing implementation

## Features
- `Principal Component Analysis(PCA)`: Decomposite X=C*Y+d, which extracts principal component out out matrix
- `k-means`: Use kmeans clustering that partitions image into k clusters
- `superpixels`: Reduce pixels count of image, and still have the major data info kept
- `Non-Negative Matrix Factorization(NMF)`: Try to recover masked hyper-spectral image with interpolation
- `2D DFT-denoise`: Use Discrete Fourier Transform to recover noise-polluted image
